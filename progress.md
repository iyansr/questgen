## Session Log

### Session 001

- Date: 2026-06-19
- Goal: Use topic as temporary session title, then generate a short AI title from the produced questions once generation completes.
- Completed:
  - Session creation now sets `title = topic` for all three paths (file/web/document) in `sessions.service.ts`.
  - Added lightweight `MODELS.TITLE` (env override `QUESTGEN_TITLE_MODEL`) in `shared/config/models.ts` and `packages/env/env.d.ts`.
  - New `generation/title.service.ts`: samples generated questions + level context, calls lightweight model for a short Indonesian title, persists to `questionSets.title`.
  - Wired a best-effort `generate-title` step into `generation.workflow.ts` (runs after `generate-questions`, before `mark-completed`; errors swallowed so the temporary title survives).
- Verification run: `tsc --noEmit` (apps/server) → no errors; biome check on changed files → clean.
- Evidence captured: typecheck output "TypeScript: No errors found".
- Commits: none yet.
- Files or artifacts updated: sessions.service.ts, models.ts, env.d.ts, title.service.ts (new), document-processor.ts, generation.workflow.ts.
- Known risk or unresolved issue: title generation not exercised end-to-end against a live workflow run.
- Next best step: run an end-to-end session and confirm the title updates from topic to the generated title in the dashboard/detail views.
